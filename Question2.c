    // This is the first programming (scripting) question without any initial setup as hints.

    // This is also the first question requiring you to come up with an algorithm on paper 
    // with mathematical analysis before implementing the code.

    // High Level Hint:
    //  Assume a 3x3 square matrix, look at the SUM of the row and column indices of each element.
    //  You should be able to see a numerical pattern after doing so.
